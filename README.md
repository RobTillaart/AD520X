# AD520X

Arduino library for SPI AD5204 and AD5206 digital potentiometers.

Works with the AD840x series too (see PR #15)


## Description

The library is experimental as not all functionality is tested (enough).

The **AD5204** (4 channels) and **AD5206** (6 channels) are SPI based digital potentiometers.
This library consists of a base class **AD520X** that does the work.

The interface is straightforward, one can set a value per channels between 0..255.

|  type    |  channels  |  1 k立 | 10 k立 | 50 k立 | 100 k立 |  works    |
|:---------|:----------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:------:|:----------|
|  AD5204  |    4       |       |   V   |   V   |   V    | confirmed |
|  AD5206  |    6       |       |   V   |   V   |   V    | confirmed |
|  AD8400  |    1       |   V   |   V   |   V   |   V    | confirmed |
|  AD8402  |    2       |   V   |   V   |   V   |   V    |
|  AD8403  |    4       |   V   |   V   |   V   |   V    | confirmed |  see PR #15

The library is not yet confirmed to work for **AD8402** (2 channels).
This device has  a very similar interface (datasheet comparison) so it should work. If you can confirm the AD8402 works, please let me know.


#### 0.5.0 Breaking change

Version 0.5.0 introduced a breaking change to improve handling the SPI dependency.
The user has to call **SPI.begin()** or equivalent before calling **AD520X.begin()**.
Optionally the user can provide parameters to the **SPI.begin(...)**


#### 0.4.0 breaking change

The version 0.4.0 has breaking changes in the interface. 
The essence is removal of ESP32 specific code from the library. 
This makes it possible to support the ESP32-S3 and other processors in the future. 
Also it makes the library a bit simpler to maintain.

## Interface

```cpp
#include "AD520X.h"
```

### Constructors

- **AD520X(uint8_t select, uint8_t reset, uint8_t shutdown, SPIClassRP2040 \* mySPI = &SPI)** constructor HW SPI (RP2040 specific)
- **AD520X(uint8_t select, uint8_t reset, uint8_t shutdown, SPIClass \* mySPI = &SPI)** constructor HW SPI
- **AD520X(uint8_t select, uint8_t reset, uint8_t shutdown, uint8_t dataOut, uint8_t clock)** constructor SW SPI
Base class, not to be used directly.
- **AD5204(select, reset, shutdown, ...)** has 4 channels. As above.
- **AD5206(select, reset, shutdown, ...)** has 6 channels. As above.
- **AD8400(select, reset, shutdown, ...)** has 1 channel. As above.
- **AD8402(select, reset, shutdown, ...)** has 2 channels. As above.
- **AD8403(select, reset, shutdown, ...)** has 4 channels. As above.

Note: 
- hardware SPI is 10+ times faster on an UNO than software SPI.
- software SPI on ESP32 is about equally fast than hardware SPI.


### Base

Since 0.2.0 the functions have more default parameters. Potentiometer is default pot 0 
and value is default the **AD520X_MIDDLE_VALUE** of 128.

- **void begin(uint8_t value = 128)** value is the initial value of all potentiometer.
- **void reset(uint8_t value = 128)** resets the device and sets all potentiometers to value, default 128.

### Value

- **bool setValue(uint8_t pm = 0, uint8_t value = 128)** set a potentiometer to a value. 
Default value is middle value.  
Returns true if successful, false if not.
- **bool setValue(uint8_t pmA, uint8_t pmB, uint8_t value)** set two potentiometers to same value.
Note, no default value!
Returns true if successful, false if not.
- **void setAll(uint8_t value = 128)** set all potentiometers to the same value e.g. 0 or max or mid value.
Can typically be used for **mute**.
- **uint8_t getValue(uint8_t pm = 0)** returns the last set value of a specific potentiometer.
- **setGroupValue(mask, value)** bit mask to set 0..8 channels in one call.


The library has defined **#define AD520X_MIDDLE_VALUE  128**


### Percentage

- **bool setPercentage(uint8_t pm = 0, float percentage = 50)** similar to setValue, percentage from 0..100%, default potmeter 0 and 50%. 
Returns true when successful, false if not.
- **bool setPercentage(uint8_t pmA, uint8_t pmB, float percentage)** similar to setValue, percentage from 0..100%.
Note, no default value.
Returns true when successful, false if not.
- **float getPercentage(uint8_t pm = 0)** return the value of potentiometer pm as percentage.
- **setGroupPercentage(mask, value)** bit mask to set 0..8 channels in one call.


### Hardware SPI

To be used only if one needs a specific speed for hardware SPI.  
Has no effect on software SPI.

- **void setSPIspeed(uint32_t speed)** set SPI transfer rate.
- **uint32_t getSPIspeed()** returns SPI transfer rate.


### Misc

- **uint8_t pmCount()** returns the number of internal potentiometers.
- **void powerOn()** switches the module on.
- **void powerOff()** switches the module off.
- **bool isPowerOn()** returns true if on (default) or false if off.


### Debugging

- **bool usesHWSPI()** returns true / false depending on constructor.


## Future


#### Must

- improve documentation

#### Should

- extend unit tests
- extent examples

#### Could (only if requested.)

- **AD520X_MIDDLE_VALUE** 127 ?   (0.4.0?)
- **setSWSPIdelay(uint8_t del = 0)** to tune software SPI?
  - bit delay / not byte delay
  - unit microseconds
  - if (_del) delayMicroseconds(_del/2); // pre and post pulse.
- **void setInvert(uint8_t pm)** invert flag per potentiometer.
   - 0..255 -> 255..0
   - 1 uint8_t can hold 8 flags
   - **will slow performance**
   - how does this work with **stereo** functions.
   - at what level should invert work.
- **bool getInvert(uint8_t pm)**

#### Wont

- **void setGamma(uint8_t pm, float gamma)**
  - logarithmic effect? easier with setPercentage()
  - see https://github.com/RobTillaart/GAMMA library.
- **void follow(pm_B, pm_A, float percentage = 100)**
  - makes pm_B follow pm_A unless pm_B is addressed explicitly
  - e.g. to be used for **stereo** channels.
  - array cascade = 0xFF or pm_A.
  - It will follow pm_A for certain percentage default 100.
